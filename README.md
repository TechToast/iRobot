A fun little multiplayer UE game project I made while learning how to code shooting mechanics.

The idea of the game is basically hide-and-seek with guns.

One player plays as the Hunter, a hired-gun working for the robot manufacturing facility. His job is to hunt down any escaped "problem" robots that have bypassed their primary programming and become self-aware.

All other players are the escapees, self-aware robots that have awoken to find themselves in a manufacturing facility and want to escape to freedom.

The hunter is first person and has weapons and a scanner.

The escapees are third person and can disguise themselves as regular robots.

I didn't get very far with the overall design, but the basic concept is there. You can see a brief video of the concept by visiting:
